bio
</font>
<font size= "3" color = "#8df7b9" face="Cooper">
<p>Carrie Panetta grew up in Rugby, North Dakota. She received her bachelor's degree from the University of North Dakota and received her J.D. from the University of Virginia Law School. After law school she worked as an associate attorney for private firms, such as Brobeck. But, she did not enjoy the busy lifestyle involved with working for a firm and wanted to work for the county as a district attorney instead. So, she became a Deputy District Attorney for Alameda County. Following this decision came the decision to be a judge. She worked as a judge for the Superior Court of Alameda County and then moved to Monterey, where she is currently a judge for the Superior Court of Monterey.</p>

why i chose her
</font>
<font size= "3" color = "#8df7b9" face="Cooper">
<p>I chose this person as my hero because she is very inspiring in how hard she works. She is a working mother of two kids, me being one of them, and still manages to have the time to be a kind, supportive, and incredible mother. She has accomplished an impressive amount of work during her time as a judge and was a very skilled lawyer. She motivates me everyday with her positive and loving attitude and I hope to be like her in the future.</p>
